# Resource Optimization

This folder consists of Kyverno policies that can be used to generate VPA (vertical Pod Autoscalers) and also check if the resources requested by pod controllers are within the limits suggested by the VPA recommender. For more information on how Kyverno can be used along with VPA and Opencost, please check the blog [here](https://nirmata.com/2024/08/15/kubernetes-policy-driven-resource-optimization-with-kyverno/). Walk through video of how this works can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmZv22poxnI). The article on how Adidas Platform Team Reduced the Cost of Running Kubernetes Clusters using Kyverno and VPA's can be found [here](https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/07/adidas-kubernetes-cost-reduction/)
