# Resource Optimization

This folder consists of Kyverno policies that can be used to generate VPA (vertical Pod Autoscalers) and also check if the resources requested by pod controllers are within the limits suggested by the VPA recommender. For more information on how Kyverno can be used along with VPA and Opencost, please check the blog [here](https://nirmata.com/2024/08/15/kubernetes-policy-driven-resource-optimization-with-kyverno/).
